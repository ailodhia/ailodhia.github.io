<section id="intro"><h2> Introduction </h2> </section>
<p> Welcome! I am a researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,
where I am supervised by 
<a href="https://www.carolineuhler.com/">Caroline Uhler</a>.
I recently (May 2020) finished my NSF RTG postdoc at the University
of Michigan Statistics Department where my supervisor was 
<a href="http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/" >Elizaveta Levina</a>. 
Prior to this I obtained my PhD on June 2017 at the MIT
Mathematics Department where I was advised by 
<a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/aguionne/">Alice Guionnet</a>.  
Before doing my PhD, I graduated in 2012 from UC Davis with a Bachelors degree in
Mathematics and Physics. For the academic year of 2020&ndash;2021 I was unable
to start a position abroad (outside of the United States) due to COVID. 
I am interested in probability theory and its applications to problems in statistics.
</p>

<section id="research" > <h2> Research </h2> </section>

<p> Most of my research has been in the area of random matrices and a
few related fields.  In many of my papers I study the behavior of
linear statistics of eigenvalues. Lately, I've been thinking about
causal inference and its applications to biology and medical research. 
Below are a list of my publications and preprints. </p>

<section id="teaching"> <h2> Teaching </h2> </section>

<p> Below are a list of classes I have taught at the University
of Michigan. If you are a past
student and need a letter of recommendation feel free to request
one. Depending on the letter requested (graduate school application,
job application, etc&hellip;) I would appreciate an appropriate amount
of time to write the letter. I can write a better letter for you if
we've had interactions in or out of class, or if you've distinguished
yourself in some way.

<p>
I have experience doing directed readings with undergraduates from my
time in graduate school where I participated three times in the MIT
Mathematics Directed Reading program and during my postdoc at Michigan
where I organized a Reinforcement Learning directed reading group.
